    # The HTTP POST binding defines a mechanism by which SAML protocol messages may be transmitted
    # within the base64-encoded content of an HTML form control.
    #
    # This binding MAY be composed with the HTTP Redirect binding (see Section 3.4) and the HTTP Artifact
    # binding (see Section 3.6) to transmit request and response messages in a single protocol exchange using
    # two different bindings.
    #
    # The HTTP POST binding is intended for cases in which the SAML requester and responder need to
    # communicate using an HTTP user agent (as defined in HTTP 1.1 [RFC2616]) as an intermediary. This
    # may be necessary, for example, if the communicating parties do not share a direct path of communication.
    # It may also be needed if the responder requires an interaction with the user agent in order to fulfill the
    # request, such as when the user agent must authenticate to it.
    #
    # Note that some HTTP user agents may have the capacity to play a more active role in the protocol
    # exchange and may support other bindings that use HTTP, such as the SOAP and Reverse SOAP
    # bindings. This binding assumes nothing apart from the capabilities of a common web browser.
    #
    # See SAML 2.0 Bindings spec, section 3.5 for more info.
